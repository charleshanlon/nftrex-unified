# nftrex-unified

 demo will be spun up at https://www.nft-rex.titorlabs.io

 run locally by opening each of the three folders. run npm start for react/api and python3 rex.py. This will open a react front end on port 3000, a node backend on port 5000, and a flask backend on port 5001.

 note that this project is still a work in progress at time of submission, however most of the work is simple deployment, cloud architecture, code refactoring etc.
